# Express-TypeScript-Template

*A template for Express server written in TypeScript ðŸ¤”* The template's aim was for a minimal, unopinionated Express-TypeScript experience, therefore I decided to not include any testing tools, feel free to use it with whatever works best for you.

## Getting Started
You can choose *either* generate a project from the template (recommended way) or clone it:

#### Create project from template
```console
https://github.com/phamduylong/express-typescript-template/generate
```

#### Clone
```console
git clone https://github.com/phamduylong/express-typescript-template.git
```

## Scripts

#### Build
```console
npm run build
```

#### Start project
```console
npm run start
```

#### Dev mode
```console
npm run dev
```
